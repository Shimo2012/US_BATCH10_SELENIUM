XPATH

Pros
-> Can locate any element you want. If you know Xpath you don't need other locators.
-> It is the most efficient one
-> Can locate any element with its visible text
-> Can locate elements by their index. For example if there are multiple elements with the same locator we can say we want the 3rd one
-> Can locate a parent element by using its child.

Cons
-> It works slower than the other locators. It slows down test execution. So it should be the last option

//tagName[@attributeName="value"] --> Relative Xpath
html/body/form/input  --> Absolute Xpath(Never use it. Because if a new element is added between html and the
element you want to locate, your locator would not work)

Interview Question: How many xpaths are there? Answer: 2 Relative and Absolute
Interview Question: Which one do you use and why? Answer: Relative. Because if developers add a new element
between your elements this locator wouldn't work

<div id="username">

    <span>Hello 1</span>
    <input class="firstname">
    <span> Hello 2 </span>

    <div>
	    <img src="image1.png"/>
	    <img src="image2.png"/>
        <input type="text"/>
    </div>

</div>
<label> Hello </label>

//input[@class="firstname"]  --> Gives the input element with a class attribute with the value of firstname
//span[text()="Hello 1"] --> Gives the span element with Hello 1 visible text
